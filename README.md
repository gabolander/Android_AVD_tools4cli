# Android_AVD_tools4cli
Tools for running Android AVD and installing GooglePlay in ANDROID AVD x86

##  Work in progress ...

#### At the moment, only run_avd is working (in italian, right now).
**run_avd** script, can run with or without parameters.
If run *without parameters* it shows a list of your currently installed avds and let you choose which one to start.

If run with a parameter:
- if it's a number, it runs the Nth avd of the showed list.
- if it's a words, it will be used as pattern to list all the machines whose name matches this pattern. If it's only one, that AVD will be launched, otherwise a new list of matching pattern will be shown and it will let you choose which one to run.


# Please be patient for the Google Play installer script :-)
